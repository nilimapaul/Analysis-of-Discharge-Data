Problem Statement:

Assume that as a civil engineer you have to analyze discharge data (X) collected independently at
four sites. For each site you have to find:
• the magnitude of discharge xk such that P(X  xk) = 0.01 along with 90% confidence interval
for xk.
• Test the hypothesis that the mean discharge is equal to 2500 units.
